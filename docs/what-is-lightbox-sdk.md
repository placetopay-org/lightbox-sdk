# What is Lightbox SDK?

Lightbox SDK is a comprehensive npm library designed to make it easy to handle iframes within your app in the form of modals. It allows you to create, manipulate, and control iframes efficiently and effectively.

It can be easily used by following a few steps. You can open a lightbox simply by providing the destination URL, or you have the option to configure it in more detail if needed, as it provides a number of features that allow you to interact with the iframe in different ways. For example, you can send styles to the iframe, hide the close button, close or redirect the iframe, or emit custom events.
