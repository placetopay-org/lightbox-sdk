It can be easily used by following a few steps. You can open a lightbox simply by providing the destination URL, or you have the option to configure it in more detail if needed, as it provides a number of features that allow you to interact with the iframe in different ways. For example, you can set some styles of the iframe, hide the close button, close it directly, and most interestingly, emit custom events.
